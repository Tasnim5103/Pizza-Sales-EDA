# Pizza-Sales-EDA
A detailed analysis on maven pizza analysis by Python

In this project i have analized plato's pizza sales throghout the year and presented my related findings using python(numpy, pandas, seaborn).

This project uses a xlsx file which contains all the information we want about the pizza sales and then use other libraries such as Pandas, matplotlib , seaborn and emoji to wrangle the data.

To go through every step, go and check the jupyter notebook file attached.

I have also created one viz in Tableau with this data https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tazalli.tasnim/viz/MavenPizza_16686160814040/MavenDashboard. Check this out as well.
